## 🚀 The Vision for OpenPineScript

OpenPineScript is a "Software Craftsperson" project dedicated to building the fastest, most compliant open-source runtime for executing scripts. Our goal is to provide a high-performance, local-first environment that respects the privacy and execution speed of the modern trader, optimized for web as well as local hardware.

## 🛠 The "Solo Core" Development Model

To maintain 100% architectural integrity, extreme performance optimization, and rapid development velocity, **OpenPineScript is developed and maintained exclusively by a solo author.** To ensure the engine remains lean and the code remains "Grade 2" quality, **we are not accepting Pull Requests (PRs) at this time.**

### Why we do this:

* **Architectural Consistency:** Every line of code follows a unified design pattern, ensuring the engine stays lightweight.
* **Rapid Iteration:** We ship updates for new versions in days, not months, by bypassing the traditional corporate review cycle.
* **Precision:** Maintaining a single-author codebase ensures that the logic behind the lexer, parser, and VM is perfectly synchronized.

## 💡 How to Contribute

While the core code is solo, the roadmap is driven by the community. Your feedback is what hardens the engine.

### 1. Reporting a Bug

If you find a script that doesn't execute as expected, please use the following template in a new GitHub Issue:

> **[BUG] - [Brief Description]**
> * **Script Version:** (e.g., //@version=2, v3, etc.)
> * **Code Snippet:** [Paste the code that triggered the issue]
> * **Expected Result:** [What the output should be]
> * **Actual Result:** [What our engine produced]
> * **Environment:** [OS / Hardware used]
> 
> 

### 2. Requesting a Feature

If there is a specific technical limitation in other environments you want us to solve, use this template:

> **[FEATURE] - [Name of Feature]**
> * **Description:** [What should the engine do?]
> * **Use Case:** [How does this help your trading or backtesting?]
> * **Priority:** (Low / Medium / High)
> 
>

## 📜 Intellectual Property & Licensing

OpenPineScript is released under the **GNU GPL**. This ensures the code remains free and open for the community forever. By providing feedback or bug reports, you are helping build a world-class standard for script execution that puts the power back into the hands of the individual developer.
