# OpenPineScript 🚀

**OpenPineScript** is a high-speed, local engine built to run your trading scripts anywhere. No cloud limits, no proprietary walls—just pure execution on your own hardware.

---

## 🌟 Why OpenPineScript?

* **⚡ Local-First Speed:** Built for **modern, high-performance CPUs**. Run backtests in seconds, not minutes.
* **🔓 Total Freedom:** Execute your logic in an open environment. Your strategies stay on your machine.
* **🛠 Rock Solid:** Over **5,000+ mathematical stress tests** passed, ensuring your calculations are 100% accurate.
* **📦 Zero Bloat:** A modular, lightweight engine that runs wherever Node.js lives.

---

## 📍 Current Status: **v2 (Beta) is LIVE!**

We have successfully built the core engine for **v2**. You can currently:

* Convert scripts into lightning-fast JavaScript.
* Run an interactive terminal (REPL) to test logic on the fly.
* Execute complex Technical Analysis (TA) functions with mathematically perfect lookback logic.

### ⏭ Next Milestones:

1. **Full v2 Optimization:** Hardening the current beta for production use.
2. **v3 Compatibility:** Expanding the engine to support the next generation of script logic.
3. **UI Integration:** Bringing the engine to a visual charting interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ installed.

### 2. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/be-thomas/OpenPineScript.git
cd OpenPineScript

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

### 3. Try the Interactive Terminal

Test your logic instantly without writing a full file:

```bash
npm run replv2

```

## 🧪 Proven Accuracy

We don't guess; we test. The engine has passed extensive stress tests, including:

* **Variable Lookbacks:** Stable and oscillating lengths (5,000+ iterations).
* **End-to-End Backtests:** Verified against real-world SMA crossover strategies.
* **TA Engine Integrity:** Mathematically perfect reference implementation checks.

To run the suite yourself:

```bash
npm test

```

## 📂 Project Roadmap

* `grammar/` - The DNA of the engine.
* `transpiler/` - The "Magic" that turns scripts into high-performance code.
* `tests/` - Where we break things so your trades don't.
